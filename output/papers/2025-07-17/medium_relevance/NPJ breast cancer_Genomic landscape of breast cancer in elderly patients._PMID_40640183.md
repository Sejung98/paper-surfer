## Abstract
Breast cancer (BC) displays age-related histopathologic and transcriptomic heterogeneity. Whether BC in elderly patients differs genetically from that of younger individuals remains unclear. We re-analyzed sequencing data from 1918 BCs previously subjected to an FDA-cleared paired tumor-normal targeted sequencing assay across elderly (≥65 years), middle-aged (>45 and <65 years) and young (≥45 years) patients. BCs in elderly individuals exhibited fewer germline but were numerically enriched in somatic homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)/DNA damage response (DDR) genetic alterations. Primary ER+/HER2- BC in elderly patients showed shifts in the spectrum of actionable PI3K/AKT alterations, whereas metastatic cases were enriched in FAT1 and RB1 mutations and fewer ESR1 mutations, suggesting age-dependent therapeutic resistance mechanisms. Metastatic ER+/HER2- lobular BCs were enriched in actionable ERBB2 mutations. Resistance-associated alterations were more prevalent in metastatic vs primary BC in elderly patients. Our findings reveal distinct actionable genetic features in elderly patients, highlighting the importance of genomic profiling and treatment personalization in this population.

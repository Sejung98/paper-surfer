## Abstract
Breast cancer liver metastasis presents a significant clinical challenge, requiring a deeper understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we explored the role of serum metabolites and gut microbiota in breast cancer liver metastasis, with a particular focus on the effects of glycochenodeoxycholic acid sodium salt (GCDC). Serum metabolites were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), while gut microbiota composition was assessed through 16S rDNA sequencing of stool samples. Statistical analyses revealed a strong correlation between gut microbiota and GCDC levels, which varied markedly among breast cancer, breast cancer liver metastasis, and healthy control groups. GCDC was identified as a microbiota-related metabolite through high-throughput bioinformatics screening. In vitro experiments showed that GCDC inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inducing cell death. In vivo, GCDC treatment reduced subcutaneous tumor growth and prevented liver metastases, as evidenced by decreased Ki67 expression in tumor tissues. These findings suggested that GCDC suppresses breast cancer liver metastasis by inhibiting cancer cell growth and migration, underscoring its potential as a biomarker for early detection and a therapeutic agent for liver metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Further research is needed to clarify its mechanisms and explore its clinical applications.

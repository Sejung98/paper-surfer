## Abstract
Exercise training has been demonstrated to ameliorate adverse effects among cancer patients undergoing various treatment approaches. Exercise training has been demonstrated to ameliorate adverse effects among patients with early-stage (I-III) breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers undergoing various treatment approaches. However, the application of exercise in advanced or metastatic cancers requires careful clinical evaluation and supervision. Studies indicate that exercise correlates with diminished pain and fatigue, as well as enhanced quality of life for cancer patients. Besides exercise training, flavonoids such as quercetin have exhibited beneficial effects across various cancer types, bolstering the body's defense mechanisms. The integration of exercise and quercetin supplementation in cancer treatment has potential, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways remain incompletely understood. This manuscript explores the intricate interplay between exercise and quercetin at the molecular level, emphasizing their combined effects on cancer therapy. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we highlight the multifaceted roles of exercise and quercetin in modulating molecular signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and treatment response. Insights into these mechanisms shed light on the synergistic effects of exercise and quercetin, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in cancer management. This review underscores the importance of further research to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay of exercise and quercetin and their implications for cancer treatment.

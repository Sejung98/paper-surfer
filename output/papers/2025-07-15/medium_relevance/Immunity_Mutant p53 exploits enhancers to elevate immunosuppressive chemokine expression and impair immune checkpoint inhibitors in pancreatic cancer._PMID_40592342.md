## Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer characterized by activating KRAS mutations and TP53 alterations. TP53 missense mutations lose their wild-type tumor-suppressor function. Here, we studied whether p53 missense mutations have potential gain-of-function oncogenic roles and their impact on cancer-cell-intrinsic gene expression and the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) in PDAC. p53

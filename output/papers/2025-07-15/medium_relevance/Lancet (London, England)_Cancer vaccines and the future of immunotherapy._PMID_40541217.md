## Abstract
Vaccines have had a major impact on the control of infectious disease, most recently by helping to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Prophylactic cancer vaccines have prevented several malignancies by protecting against cancer-causing pathogens. By contrast, therapeutic vaccines training the immune system to eliminate established tumours are now showing real promise in clinical settings. In the adjuvant setting, vaccines against melanoma and pancreatic cancer appear to be reducing minimal residual disease and relapse. In the macrometastatic setting, in-situ vaccines have induced systemic regressions in advanced-stage lung and breast cancers and lymphomas. More effective cancer vaccines are being developed through having a deeper understanding of crucial cellular factors in tumour immunology, the incorporation of newer vaccine components to effectively mobilise and activate cells, the use of omics and artificial intelligence in vaccine design, and addition of immune checkpoint blockade. In this Viewpoint, we analyse cancer vaccine trials, the strengths and limitations of different vaccine approaches, and we discuss how the next generation of cancer vaccines can help improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

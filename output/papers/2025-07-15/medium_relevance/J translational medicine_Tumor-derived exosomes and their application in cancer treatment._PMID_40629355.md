## Abstract
BACKGROUND: Tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) are vesicles characterized by their nanoscale size, secreted through cancer cells to boost the intercellular communications of the tumor microenvironment. TDEs enclose a cocktail of bioactive molecules, such as proteins, lipids, RNA, and DNA, which can encourage angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis to enhance tumor progression. Researchers are now interested in tumor-derived exosomes as markers and potential novel vehicles for the delivery of therapeutics in cancer treatment since they exhibit different molecular profiles and biological functions. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were methodically explored for articles estimating the dual functions of TDEs and their potential applications as new therapeutic targets and drug delivery vehicles for the transportation of anti-cancer drugs and immune-modulating compounds. RESULT: TDEs represent great promise in advancing cancer diagnostics and therapy through their portrayal in cell communication, tumor regulation, and immune modulation. They offer potential for noninvasive, targeted treatment and early detection. However, standardization, reproducibility, and immune interaction challenges must be addressed. Continued interdisciplinary research is essential to realize their clinical potential fully. CONCLUSION: Advancements in exosome engineering denote auspicious alternatives to conventional cancer therapies, with benefits like reduced toxicity and enhanced targeting. Understanding the biology of TDEs implements the development of novel treatments and improves diagnostics, prognostics, and monitoring of cancer progression. Integrating TDE-based tools with personalized medicine credits the potential to transform cancer care by providing more effective and individualized therapies.

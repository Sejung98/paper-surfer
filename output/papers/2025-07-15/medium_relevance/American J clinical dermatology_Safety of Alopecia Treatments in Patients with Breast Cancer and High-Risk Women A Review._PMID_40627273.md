## Abstract
Patients with, survivors of, and women at increased risk of breast cancer may experience various hair loss disorders, including those related to cancer treatments (such as chemotherapy- or endocrine therapy-induced alopecia), alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia, and cicatricial alopecias. In the USA, approximately 1 in 8 women (13.1%) will develop breast cancer during their lifetime, emphasizing the importance of understanding safe treatment options for this population. Management of scarring and nonscarring alopecias in patients with or those at high risk of breast cancer requires the selection of therapies that do not impact breast cancer risk, treatment, or outcomes. In this review, we examine the safety of common medications used in the treatment of alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia, and cicatricial alopecias with regard to breast cancer. We provide evidence-based recommendations for the use of these treatments in patients with and women at elevated risk of breast cancer while highlighting areas where further research is needed.

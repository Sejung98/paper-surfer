## Abstract
PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: This review provides an update on the literature concerning PECS blocks and some other thoracic plane blocks. RECENT FINDINGS: Research over the last 2 years has primarily focused on the application of PECS blocks in breast cancer, thoracic, and cardiac anesthesia. SUMMARY: PECS blocks have consistently been demonstrated to be safe, easy to perform, and effective, with no reported complications. Their efficacy has been validated by multiple independent scientific groups, particularly in terms of reducing opioid requirements and improving procedural outcomes. On the basis of this body of evidence, clinicians should weigh the benefits of various regional techniques, considering both complication rates and their own level of expertise.

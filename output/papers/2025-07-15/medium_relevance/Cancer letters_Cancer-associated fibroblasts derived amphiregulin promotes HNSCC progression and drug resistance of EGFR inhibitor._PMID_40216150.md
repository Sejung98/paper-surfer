## Abstract
In clinical oncology, lack of sustained treatment response is very common in cancer patients and largely limits the efficiency of most anticancer targeted-therapies. While anti-EGFR therapeutics have been extensively employed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) management, their clinical efficacy remains limited due to unresolved resistance mechanisms. Notably, the functional role of EGFR ligand proteins in both tumor progression and therapeutic response has not been fully elucidated. Here we reveal that amphiregulin (AREG) as a potential driver of drug resistance of EGFR-targeted treatment in HNSCC patients. We identify a PDGFRŒ≤

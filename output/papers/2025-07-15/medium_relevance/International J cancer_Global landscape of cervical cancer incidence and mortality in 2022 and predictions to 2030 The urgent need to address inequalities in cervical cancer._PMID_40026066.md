## Abstract
Cervical cancer remains a major public health challenge worldwide, despite being largely preventable through effective interventions. Timely evidence regarding the global landscape of cervical cancer is crucial for measuring the magnitude of inequalities and monitoring progress towards cervical cancer elimination. We aimed to provide an updated overview of the global burden of cervical cancer using the GLOBOCAN 2022 database. Age-standardized rates of incidence and mortality were presented according to countries, 20 United Nations-defined world regions, and four-tier Human Development Index (HDI) levels. The predicted burden of cervical cancer for 2030 was calculated based on global demographic projections. Globally, an estimated 662,301 new cervical cancer cases and 348,874 deaths occurred in 2022. Substantial geographic disparities in cervical cancer burden existed across countries and world regions. Low HDI countries exhibited two times higher incidence rates and five times higher mortality rates, compared to very high HDI countries. For women aged 15-44 years, cervical cancer ranked among the top three most frequent cancers in 149 countries, and among the top three causes of cancer deaths in 154 countries. If 2022 rates remain unchanged, the global burden of cervical cancer was predicted to increase to 760,082 new cases (a 14.8% increase) and 411,035 deaths (a 17.8% increase) by 2030. Our findings highlight the persistent and widening geographic and socioeconomic inequalities in the burden of cervical cancer. There is an urgent need for tailored national strategies to address these inequalities and accelerate progress towards the goal of cervical cancer elimination.

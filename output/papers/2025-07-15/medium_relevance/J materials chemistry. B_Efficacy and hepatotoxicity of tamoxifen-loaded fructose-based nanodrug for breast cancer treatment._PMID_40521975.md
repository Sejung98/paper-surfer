## Abstract
Breast cancer is one of the most harmful diseases affecting human health. Low drug accumulation at the tumor site and the severe side effects of traditional chemotherapeutics compromise their effectiveness in breast cancer treatment. Utilizing nanocarriers for targeted delivery and controlled release of therapeutics to cancer cells could be a promising pathway to alleviate these problems. Herein, we synthesized a novel prodrug conjugate coupling hydrophilic fructooligosaccharide with hydrophobic tamoxifen

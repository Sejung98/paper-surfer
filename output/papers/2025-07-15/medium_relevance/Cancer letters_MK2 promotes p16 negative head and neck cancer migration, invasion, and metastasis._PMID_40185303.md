## Abstract
For patients with locally advanced, p16-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), overall survival remains poor due to primary locoregional failure and distant metastasis following curative therapy. We aimed to understand how MAPKAPK2 (MK2) regulates HNSCC tumor cell migration and invasion, important first steps in cancer metastases. The TCGA database and HNSCC tissue microarrays were used to show that MK2 expression was associated with more advanced cancers and faster cancer recurrence rates. We observed that silencing of tumor MK2 in human cell lines (shRNA) caused a significant reduction in tumor cell migration-invasion in a complex HNSCC microphysiologic system used to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment. Murine cells (Ly2) with MK2 silenced (CRISPR-Cas9) also demonstrated reduced migration and invasion using 2D and 3D monoculture cell migration-invasions assays. Ly2 cells are orthotopic p16-negative murine metastatic cells that spontaneously metastasize, and we observed that MK2 inhibition via genetic (Cas9/CRISPR) or pharmacologic (PF-3644022) methods led to a significant reduction in the number of circulating tumor cells, fewer lymph node and lung metastases, and MK2 inhibited mice showed improved overall survival. Our findings suggest that HNSCC MK2 regulates tumor cell migration-invasion and may be a promising therapeutic target to reduce metastases.

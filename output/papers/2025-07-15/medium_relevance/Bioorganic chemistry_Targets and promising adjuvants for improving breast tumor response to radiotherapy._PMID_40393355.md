## Abstract
Breast cancer ranks among the most common cancers globally, with significant mortality rates in advanced stages. Despite progress in treatment, therapy resistance, particularly to radiotherapy, remains a major challenge. Radiosensitization offers a promising solution to enhance radiotherapy effectiveness. This approach specifically increases tumor cells' vulnerability to IR. Recent research has explored molecular targets and strategies to improve radiosensitivity in breast cancer. Examples include inhibiting DNA repair pathways, altering the TME, targeting signaling pathways, and using immunomodulators. These strategies not only amplify destructive effects of IR but may also reduce required radiation doses, thereby minimizing normal tissue injury. This review examines promising molecular targets and combination therapies to boost radiosensitivity in breast cancer. It also highlights recent advances in immune modulation, TME remodeling, targeted molecular therapy, and metabolic pathway targeting. These advancements offer insights into the future of radiosensitization research. By systematically analyzing these strategies, the article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of radiosensitization's current state and future potential in breast cancer treatment.

## Abstract
Immunotherapy is a potential strategy to suppress the postoperative recurrence and metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the excessive accumulation of kynurenine (Kyn) leads to immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and impedes immunotherapeutic efficacy. Herein, a two-pronged approach through "Kynurenine Starvation Therapy" is proposed based on the in-situ hydrogel implantation for postsurgical treatment of TNBC. The hydrogel is constructed via Schiff base reaction between oxidized dextran (ODEX) and 8-arm poly(ethylene glycol) amine (8-arm PEG-NH

## Abstract
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are prominent components of the lung tumor stroma and are known to foster tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis through extracellular matrix (ECM) and tumor stroma remodeling. The interactions of CAFs with cancer cells and other stromal components contribute significantly to the aggressive nature of lung cancer and pose challenges to conventional treatment approaches. Simultaneously, the ECM, which contains numerous proteins and other molecules surrounding cancer cells, serves as more than just a structural scaffold. In lung cancer, alterations in ECM composition and organization not only promote tumor cell proliferation and survival but also impact drug penetration, immune cell infiltration, and therapeutic resistance. Targeting the intricate interplay between CAFs and the dynamic ECM in lung cancer represents a crucial frontier in oncology research. This review aims to delve deeply into the pivotal roles of CAFs and the ECM in the tumorigenesis and progression of lung cancer. Then, the potential of utilizing adjuvants, phytochemicals, and nanoparticles to modulate the functions of CAFs and remodel the ECM in the lung tumor will be reviewed.

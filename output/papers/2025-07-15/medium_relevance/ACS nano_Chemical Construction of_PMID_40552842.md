## Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy represents a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, leveraging the body's immune system to recognize and eradicate malignant cells. Among various strategies, in situ tumor vaccination (ISV) has emerged as a promising approach due to its potential for personalization and long-lasting antitumor effects. Despite its advantages, ISV faces significant challenges, including the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment, immunosuppressive factors, and antigen loss, which hinder its effectiveness. Innovative chemical construction techniques offer solutions to these challenges by utilizing functionalized platforms that enhance antigen capture, optimize delivery, and facilitate immune activation. By incorporating smart, responsive mechanisms, these platforms can adapt to the tumor microenvironment, improving the stability and release of immune adjuvants. This review explores the integration of chemical strategies in ISV, demonstrating how they can enhance the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy, promote personalized treatment, and address the limitations currently faced in clinical applications.

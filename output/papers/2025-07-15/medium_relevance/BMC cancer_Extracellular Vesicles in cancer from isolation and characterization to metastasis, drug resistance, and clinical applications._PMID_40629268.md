## Abstract
Cancer progression, along with other hallmarks of cancer, is sustained through bidirectional cell-to-cell communication. This function is primarily facilitated by lipid-rich nanoparticles expelled into the extracellular matrix by stromal and/or malignant cells. These entities, known as extracellular vesicles, contain a vast repertoire of bioactive molecules and hold promise as potential biomarkers and nanovehicles for drug delivery. Intriguingly, the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the functions of extracellular vesicles remain poorly understood. In the present manuscript, we highlight the intracellular and intercellular journey of extracellular vesicles, from their inception to the present day, their implications in various hallmarks of cancer, and their clinical applications.

## Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy that urgently needs more effective therapies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) contribute to the aggressive and chemo-resistant nature of the disease by creating a drug-impeding fibrotic microenvironment. We developed novel compounds, the racemate CRO-05 and its active enantiomer CRO-67, which target both pancreatic tumor and CAF cells with robust anti-cancer activity. These compounds were designed using rational medicinal chemistry based on chromans, a class of anti-cancer drugs. Their therapeutic potential and efficacy were assessed in a clinically relevant patient-derived PDAC tumor explant model, which mimics the disease's 3-dimensional complexity. CRO-67 treatment in these explants significantly reduced tumor cell and Œ±SMA

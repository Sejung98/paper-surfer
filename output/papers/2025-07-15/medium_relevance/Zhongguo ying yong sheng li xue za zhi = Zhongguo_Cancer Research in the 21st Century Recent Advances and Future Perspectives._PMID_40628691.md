## Abstract
INTRODUCTION: Cancer remains a major global health concern, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths annually. Despite its complexity and heterogeneity, significant advancements in cancer research over the past two decades have transformed the landscape of cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Notably, the integration of personalized medicine and technological innovations has led to more precise, effective, and individualized care strategies. MATERIALS: This review utilized peer-reviewed articles, clinical trial data, and recent meta-analyses published between 2015 and 2025. Major databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched using keywords such as "cancer therapy," "personalized medicine," "cancer diagnostics," "immunotherapy," and "cancer prevention. METHODS: A systematic review approach was applied, focusing on studies that reported significant advancements in cancer treatment modalities (e.g., targeted therapy, immunotherapy), diagnostic technologies (e.g., liquid biopsy, AI-based imaging), and preventive strategies (e.g., vaccination, genetic screening). Articles were selected based on relevance, impact, and recency, with a preference for clinical studies and high-impact reviews. RESULTS: Emerging therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapy, and molecularly targeted agents have shown improved survival and response rates in several cancer types. Diagnostic innovations, including next-generation sequencing and non-invasive liquid biopsies, have enhanced early detection and monitoring of treatment response. Preventive measures, such as HPV and HBV vaccination and genetic risk profiling, have reduced the incidence of several preventable cancers. Personalized medicine approaches have enabled treatment decisions based on individual genetic and molecular profiles, leading to improved therapeutic outcomes and reduced adverse effects. DISCUSSION: The integration of genomics, artificial intelligence, and immunotherapy into oncology practice marks a shift toward precision medicine. While these advances have significantly improved patient care, challenges such as treatment resistance, access disparities, and the high cost of novel therapies remain. Continued interdisciplinary research, equitable healthcare policies, and investment in emerging technologies are essential to fully realize the benefits of modern cancer care.

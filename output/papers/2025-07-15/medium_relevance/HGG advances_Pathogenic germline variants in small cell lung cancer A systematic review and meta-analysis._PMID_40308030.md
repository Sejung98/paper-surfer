## Abstract
This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the prevalence and clinical impact of germline variants in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Primary objectives included estimating the prevalence of germline variants in SCLC patients, while secondary objectives focused on their effects on patient outcomes. A comprehensive search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and gray-literature databases (as of July 2024). Studies reporting germline variants in SCLC patients were included. Data were extracted to calculate pooled prevalence and hazard ratios (HRs). Study quality was assessed using the Translating ROBBINs tool, and heterogeneity was evaluated using the I

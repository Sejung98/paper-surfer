## Abstract
High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has great potential as a noninvasive, breast-conserving treatment for patients with breast cancer. The HIFU-induced antitumor immune response plays a critical role in postoperative prognosis. However, after surgery, tumor cells exhibit low immunogenicity, and severe hypoxia exacerbates the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby rendering HIFU-induced immune effects insufficient to prevent tumor recurrence and metastasis. Herein, hypoxia-responsive, crosslinked albumin-based nanoparticles (HACS NPs), comprising the hypoxia-activated prodrug AQ4N, the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist SR-717, and calcium carbonate (CaCO

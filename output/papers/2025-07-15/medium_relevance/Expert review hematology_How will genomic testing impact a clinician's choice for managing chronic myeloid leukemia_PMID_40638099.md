## Abstract
INTRODUCTION: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a disease characterized by a single diagnostic molecular abnormality and epitomizes a genetically based diagnosis and management. Targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors has revolutionized treatment and prognosis of this disease; however, a proportion of patients will experience resistance to therapy and progress to blast phase, the terminal phase of this disease. Emerging genomic profiling in CML reveals a genetically heterogenous landscape which may permit further risk stratification, personalization of treatment, and the potential for drug development.This review encompasses original literature exploring the genomic profile of CML and the potential impact of additional genomic abnormalities on prognosis and treatment response. EXPERT OPINION: Somatic variants in cancer-associated genes, particularly

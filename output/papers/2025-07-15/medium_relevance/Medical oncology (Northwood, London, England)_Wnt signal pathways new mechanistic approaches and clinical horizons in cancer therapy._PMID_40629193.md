## Abstract
Aberrant Wnt signaling is a hallmark of many cancers, driving proliferation and disease progression. This review provides a focused overview of recent research (past 10-15 years) into Wnt inhibitors as potential cancer therapeutics, emphasizing their diverse mechanisms of action at the molecular level. We examine the latest findings regarding Wnt ligand blockade, frizzled receptor antagonism, and downstream pathway modulation, assessing each approach's clinical potential and challenges. This includes a discussion of combination therapies and strategies to overcome resistance. Ultimately, this review aims to provide a clear and concise understanding of the current landscape of Wnt inhibition, guiding future research toward more precise and effective cancer treatments.

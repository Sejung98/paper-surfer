## Abstract
Neuroblastoma stands as a major concern in pediatric oncology because it develops from neural crest cells as a neuroendocrine cancer. Nanoparticle-based vaccine delivery approaches the therapeutic activity of immune cells only toward tumor cells without inflicting damage to healthy tissues like those sustained by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Neuroblastoma treatment faces two major barriers: penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and using nanoparticle technology. The promising developments for neuroblastoma treatment emerge from mRNA COVID-19 vaccine research and brain cancer vaccine clinical trials especially through phase I autologous dendritic cell vaccine studies. Future research needs to develop optimized nanoparticles which can trigger the release of mRNA or peptides based on tumor-specific pH and enzyme signals. The BBB can be opened temporarily through ultrasound and receptor-mediated transport approaches, which enhance vaccine delivery to brain tissues. New immunotherapeutic approaches for pediatric malignancies emerge from these recent findings to yield future success.

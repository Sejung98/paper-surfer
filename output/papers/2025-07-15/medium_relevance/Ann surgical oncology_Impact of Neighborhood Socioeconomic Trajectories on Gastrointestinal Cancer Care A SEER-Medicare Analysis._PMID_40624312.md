## Abstract
BACKGROUND: Historical discriminatory policies, such as residential redlining, along with current socioeconomic status, may impact gastrointestinal (GI) cancer care. We sought to investigate how evolving neighborhood characteristics impact the diagnosis and treatment of GI cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individuals who were diagnosed with GI cancer were identified using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Neighborhood socioeconomic trajectories were determined using historical redlining grades and contemporary social vulnerability index scores. These trajectories were categorized as advantaged stable (chronically affluent neighborhoods), advantaged reduced (neighborhoods with declining affluence), disadvantaged stable (neighborhoods with chronic deprivation), and disadvantaged reduced (neighborhoods with declining deprivation). Multivariable regression was utilized to examine the association between neighborhood trajectory and stage at diagnosis, cancer-directed treatment, and surgical outcomes. RESULTS: Among 15,118 individuals, 30.5% (n = 4608) resided in advantaged stable neighborhoods, 44.5% (n = 6727) in disadvantaged reduced neighborhoods, 2.96% (n = 448) in advantaged reduced neighborhoods, and 22.1% (n = 3335) in disadvantaged stable neighborhoods. Of note, individuals living in disadvantaged stable neighborhoods were less likely to undergo surgery (55.8% vs. 59.2%), receive chemotherapy (56.7% vs. 60.3%), and achieve a textbook outcome (TO) following surgery (41.3% vs. 51.3%) (all p < 0.001). On multivariable analyses, individuals living in disadvantaged stable neighborhoods had higher odds of being diagnosed at an advanced stage (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18-2.42) and lower odds of receiving chemotherapy (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.76) and achieving a TO (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.59-0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals living in disadvantaged stable neighborhoods have advanced stages at diagnosis and experience poorer surgical outcomes. There is an urgent need for targeted interventions and policies to address structural inequities and ensure health equity.

## Abstract
INTRODUCTION: Cancer patient's survival has gradually improved due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Several studies showed a possible association between the intestinal microbiome and ICI efficacy. Strategies for modifying the composition of the gut microbiome encompass various dietary interventions, which may have distinct impacts on the outcomes of ICI-treated patients. In our systematic review, we explored how dietary habits correlate with therapeutic responses in cancer patients and cancer mouse models undergoing immunotherapy. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using search terms: "cancer", "immunotherapy", "diet", and "microbiome", from Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases. The outcomes in the clinical studies were overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), or progression-free survival (PFS) in human studies. In mouse studies, change in tumor size was the endpoint. The comparator attributions were questionnaire-based dietary interventions. RESULTS: Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review (6 prospective cohort studies, 1 cross-sectional observational study, and 12 mouse studies). A consistent association was observed between high (vs. low) fiber consumption and improved therapeutic response with a pooled odds ratio of 5.79 when including all human prospective cohort studies. In mice, limited availability of methionine, cysteine, and low intake of leucine and glutamine was linked to reduced tumor progression. Combining ICIs with intermittent fasting or a fasting-mimicking diet significantly decreased tumor volume in mouse melanoma models. In humans, a higher relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and lactic acid-producing bacteria-particularly Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia muciniphila-correlated with objective response rates (ORR). Similar microbiome alterations were observed in mouse models. Increased fiber intake enhanced ICI efficacy in mice by modulating the gut microbiome, primarily via elevated SCFA production-an effect also reflected in human studies. CONCLUSION: Intermittent fasting, high fiber, and low sugar consumption are significantly associated with better ICI outcomes. The studies revealed alterations in microbiota composition linked to diet, and these findings were confirmed in animal models, regarding the production of SCFAs and lactic acid, as well as an increase in Bacteroidota/Bacillota ratio and microbial diversity.

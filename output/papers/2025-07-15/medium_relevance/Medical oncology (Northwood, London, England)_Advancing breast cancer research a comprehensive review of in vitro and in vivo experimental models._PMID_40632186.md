## Abstract
Breast cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related fatalities and illnesses all over the world; thus, understanding its complex biology and developing improved treatment strategies requires a great deal of investigation. Examining tumor growth, drug response, and treatment effectiveness involves using experimental models. The in vitro and in vivo models employed in breast cancer research are extensively reviewed in terms of their applications, advantages, and disadvantages in this paper. Researchers can use in vitro models to study drug screening, molecular pathways, and how cancer cells behave in a controlled environment. These models include two-dimensional monolayer cultures, three-dimensional spheroids, organoids, and microfluidic systems. Although these models can enable high-throughput analytical and mechanistic studies, they cannot mimic the complexity of the tumor microenvironment. It is beneficial to study tumor heterogeneity, metastasis, and immune interactions using genetically engineered mouse models, patient-derived xenografts, and syngeneic models. Differences between species and ethical concerns provide challenges. With new methods like CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, humanized mouse models, 3D bioprinting, and patient-derived organoids, the gap between preclinical findings and clinical applications is getting smaller. This makes experimental models more useful in the real world. Combining these models with computational techniques such as in vitro-in vivo extrapolation and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling helps increase the accuracy of drug development forecasts. This paper underlines the need for experimental models in furthering breast cancer research and points out ways to improve these systems. Working on present constraints using multidisciplinary cooperation and technical innovation will help us understand breast cancer better and guide us toward developing more potent treatment strategies.

## Abstract
PURPOSE: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of VR interventions in managing symptoms and improving well-being among pediatric and adult cancer patients. METHODS: In this study, between 2019 and 2024, randomized controlled studies were searched through PubMed (MEDLINE), EBSCO, and SCOPUS. MeSH (Medical Subjects Headings) were searched for keywords, and Boolean connectors were used to search for the keywords "virtual reality" AND ("cancer" OR "cancer patients"). Only randomized controlled trials focused specifically on symptom management and published in English were included in this systematic review. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools, and The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 (RoB 2) was used to evaluate the risk of bias in randomized trials. The study is registered in PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42024582573. RESULTS: A total of 637 articles were identified. After eliminating studies with repetitive and inappropriate subject titles, content, methods, or samples, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. Among them, seven studies addressed pediatric populations and eight focused on adult patients. Quality appraisal indicated that four studies demonstrated strong methodological rigor, while the remaining eleven were rated as moderate. The included studies reported that VR interventions were effective in managing a wide range of physical symptoms (e.g., pain, nausea, fatigue, sleep quality, and vital signs) and psychological symptoms (e.g., anxiety, fear, depression, mood changes, and overall well-being) in both pediatric and adult cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Through a systematic review of 15 studies, our findings underscore VR's effectiveness in overall psychological well-being and comfort among pediatric and adult cancer patients. These results highlight VR as a valuable tool in comprehensive cancer care, emphasizing its potential to alleviate symptoms and enhance the quality of life in this population.

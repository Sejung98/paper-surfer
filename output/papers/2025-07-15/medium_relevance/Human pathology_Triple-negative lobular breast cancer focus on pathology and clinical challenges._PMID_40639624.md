## Abstract
Triple-negative invasive lobular carcinoma is a rare and under-characterized subtype of breast cancer, distinct from the more common triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma. While triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma is generally recognized for its aggressive clinical behavior and lack of targeted treatment options, triple-negative invasive lobular carcinoma presents unique histopathological and molecular features that may influence its prognosis and therapeutic responsiveness. Despite these differences, triple-negative invasive lobular carcinoma remains poorly studied, leading to a reliance on treatment strategies adapted from ductal histotype, which may not fully address its biological complexities. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of triple-negative invasive lobular carcinoma by analyzing its clinicopathological characteristics, prognostic factors, and emerging therapeutic approaches. We explore the genetic alterations commonly observed in triple-negative invasive lobular carcinoma, their potential implications for treatment selection, and the challenges in current management strategies. Furthermore, we discuss the need for specialized research efforts and clinical trials to define treatment paradigms better. As precision oncology continues to evolve, understanding the biological distinctions of triple-negative invasive lobular carcinoma will be essential for optimizing patient outcomes and developing more effective treatment strategies.

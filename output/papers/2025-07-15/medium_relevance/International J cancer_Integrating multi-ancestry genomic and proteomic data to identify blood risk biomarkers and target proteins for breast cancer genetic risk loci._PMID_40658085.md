## Abstract
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 200 risk loci for breast cancer. However, target genes and their encoded proteins in these loci remain largely unknown. In this study, we utilized genetic prediction models for 1349 circulating proteins derived from individuals of African (n = 1871) and European (n = 7213) ancestry to investigate genetically predicted protein levels in association with breast cancer risk among females of African (n = 40,138), Asian (n = 137,677), and European (n = 247,173) ancestry. We identified 51 blood protein biomarkers associated with breast cancer risk, overall or by subtypes, at a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, including 27 proteins encoded by genes located at least 1 Mb away from any of the known risk loci identified in GWAS. Of them, 32 proteins showed significant associations with breast cancer risk at the Bonferroni-corrected significance level (p < 2.45 √ó 10

## Abstract
The viral hypothesis for human sporadic breast carcinoma is based on the murine model of Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV)-induced mammary tumors. Known risk factors like estrogens, obesity, and alcohol do not play a direct causal role. The Human Betaretrovirus (HBRV), also called Human Mammary Tumor Virus (HMTV), is the human homolog of MMTV, implicated in sporadic breast carcinoma (80% of ductal carcinoma in situ and 40% of invasive tumors). In contrast, hereditary breast carcinomas lack viral sequences. Murine mammary tumor histotypes are determined by specific viral strains activating definite molecular pathways via insertional mutagenesis. Similarly, the diverse histotypes observed in human invasive breast carcinoma may be influenced by a viral etiology. A study of 253 invasive breast carcinoma cases, representing 15 histotypes, detected HBRV/MMTV-ENV sequences in 20%, consistent with international literature. All histotypes tested positive except those linked to hereditary syndromes, such as medullary, apocrine, and metaplastic carcinoma. This distinction reinforces the reported lack of association between HBRV/HMTV and hereditary breast cancer, while supporting a viral etiology for sporadic carcinoma. Relevant characteristics of sporadic histotypes align with the "hit and run" hypothesis of viral carcinogenesis. Histotype differences may result from molecular pathways activated by Int genes, though mechanism beyond insertional mutagenesis and the possibility of specific HBRV strains cannot be ruled out. The potential for detected viral sequences to originate in human tumors from endogenous MMTV or contamination with murine material is critically examined.

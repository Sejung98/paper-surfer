## Abstract
Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women worldwide. While early-stage and non-invasive cases are typically managed through breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy, advanced-stage breast cancer often necessitates systemic interventions, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy. However, these conventional treatments are frequently associated with systemic toxicity and local-regional recurrence. In recent years, nanofiber-based local drug delivery systems have emerged as a promising alternative for enhancing therapeutic precision and minimizing adverse effects. Electrospun nanofibers, particularly those composed of chitosan, a naturally derived, biocompatible, and biodegradable polysaccharide, have demonstrated notable potential in cancer therapeutics. Chitosan-based nanofibers offer distinct advantages, including high surface area-to-volume ratio, controlled drug release, improved drug stability and solubility, and the ability to incorporate a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover, chitosan exhibits inherent anti-tumour properties such as anti-angiogenic, anti-metastatic, anti-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic activities, making it a versatile candidate for localized breast cancer therapy. This review comprehensively explores recent advances in the fabrication and application of chitosan nanofibers, including blended, coaxial, composite, and stimuli-responsive designs for breast cancer treatment. Furthermore, it highlights current challenges, translational barriers, and future perspectives in optimizing chitosan-based nanofibrous systems for targeted and effective breast cancer therapy.

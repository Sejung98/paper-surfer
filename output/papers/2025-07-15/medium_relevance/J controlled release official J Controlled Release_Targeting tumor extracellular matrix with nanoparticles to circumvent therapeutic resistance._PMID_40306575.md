## Abstract
Each stage of tumor development is intrinsically linked to the tumor microenvironment (TME), wherein the extracellular matrix (ECM) serves as a vital and abundant component in tumor tissues. The ECM is a non-cellular, three-dimensional macromolecular network scaffold that provides structural support to cells, stores bioactive molecules, and mediates signaling pathways through specific binding to cell surface receptors. Moreover, the ECM in tumor tissues plays a crucial role in impeding drug diffusion and resisting apoptosis induced by conventional anti-cancer therapies that primarily target cancer cells. Therefore, directing attentions towards the tumor ECM can facilitate the identification of novel targets and the development of new therapies. This review aims to summarize the composition, structure, remodeling, and function of tumor ECM, its association with drug resistance, and current targeting strategies, with a specific emphasis on nanoparticles (NPs).

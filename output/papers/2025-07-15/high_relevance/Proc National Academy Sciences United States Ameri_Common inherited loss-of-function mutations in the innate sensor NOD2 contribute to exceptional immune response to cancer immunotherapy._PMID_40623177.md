## Abstract
Lung cancers and melanomas have many somatically mutated self-proteins that would be expected to trigger an immune rejection response, yet therapeutic responses can only be induced in a subset of patients. Here, we investigated the possibility that inherited differences in immune tolerance checkpoints contribute to variability in outcomes. Whole genome sequencing revealed biallelic germline loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the immune tolerance checkpoint gene,

## Abstract
Identifying additional immune checkpoints hindering antitumor T cell responses is key to the development of next-generation cancer immunotherapies. Here, we report the induction of serotonin transporter (SERT), a regulator of serotonin levels and physiological functions in the brain and peripheral tissues, in tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells. Inhibition of SERT using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the most widely prescribed antidepressants, significantly suppressed tumor growth and enhanced T cell antitumor immunity in various mouse syngeneic and human xenograft tumor models. Importantly, SSRI treatment exhibited significant therapeutic synergy with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade, and clinical data correlation studies negatively associated intratumoral SERT expression with patient survival in a range of cancers. Mechanistically, SERT functions as a negative-feedback regulator inhibiting CD8 T cell reactivities by depleting intratumoral T cell-autocrine serotonin. These findings highlight the significance of the intratumoral serotonin axis and identify SERT as an immune checkpoint, positioning SSRIs as promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy.

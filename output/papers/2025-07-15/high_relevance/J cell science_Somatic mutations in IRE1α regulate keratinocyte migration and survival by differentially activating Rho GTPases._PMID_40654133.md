## Abstract
IRE1Œ± is an Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein with cytoplasmic kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) domains. Under ER stress, IRE1Œ± can splice Xbp1 mRNA enabling translation of this Unfolded Protein Response transcription factor or mediate sequence-specific degradation of mRNAs through Regulated IRE1Œ±-Dependent Decay (RIDD). Somatic mutations in IRE1Œ± occur in many different human cancers including non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). To understand their role in skin cancer pathogenesis, we generated immortalized primary mouse keratinocytes inducibly expressing multiple engineered and cancer-associated mutations, including those present in NMSC. All NMSC mutations tested were activating mutations with elevated autophosphorylation and enhanced RIDD activity relative to Xbp1 splicing. Pathway analysis of RNA-Seq data and in vitro studies showed that RNase-impaired mutations enhanced cell migration due to increased levels of active RhoA and a RIDD target, Angptl4. In contrast, activating mutations exhibited elevated Rac1 activation, enrichment of genes involved in DNA repair, increased phospho-ATR levels, and improved survival in response to UVB irradiation, a critical etiological factor for sun-exposed skin cancers. Together, these results suggest divergent roles of IRE1Œ± mutations by mediating critical tumor-promoting events in keratinocytes.

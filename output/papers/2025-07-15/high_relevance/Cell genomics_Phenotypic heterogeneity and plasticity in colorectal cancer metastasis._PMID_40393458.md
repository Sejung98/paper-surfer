## Abstract
Phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity in colorectal cancer (CRC) has a crucial role in tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. However, the regulatory factors and the extrinsic signals driving phenotypic heterogeneity remain unknown. Using a combination of single-cell multiomics and spatial transcriptomics data from primary and metastatic CRC patients, we reveal cancer cell states with regenerative and inflammatory phenotypes that closely resemble metastasis-initiating cells in mouse models. We identify an intermediate population with a hybrid regenerative and stem phenotype. We reveal the transcription factors AP-1 and nuclear factor Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) as their key regulators and show localization of these states in an immunosuppressive niche both at the invasive edge in primary CRC and in liver metastasis. We uncover ligand-receptor interactions predicted to activate the regenerative and inflammatory phenotype in cancer cells. Together, our findings reveal regulatory and signaling factors that mediate distinct cancer cell states and can serve as potential targets to impair metastasis.

## Abstract
Radiation therapy is essential in both curative and palliative treatments for most cancers. However, traditional radiation therapy workflows using computed tomography (CT) simulation-based planning and cone beam CT image guidance face several technical challenges, including limited tumor visibility and daily fluctuations in tumor size and shape. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided linear accelerators (MR-Linacs) address these issues by enabling precise visualization of changes in tumor position and morphologic changes, as well as changes in surrounding organs-at-risk. The hybrid MR-Linac systems combine MRI with linear accelerator technology, offering enhanced soft tissue visualization and the potential for adaptive radiation therapy (ART). This narrative review provides a comprehensive introduction to MR guided ART technologies, covering protocol optimization with appropriate pulse sequence selection and parameter adjustment for clinical implementations on various disease sites.

## Abstract
Radiotherapy, although widely used for cancer therapy, always triggers changes in tumor microenvironment (TME) that lead to radioresistance and immunosuppression. In particular, during X-ray irradiation, hypoxia exacerbation would reduce radiosensitivity of tumor cells, while programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) upregulation impairs antitumor immune responses and exacerbates DNA damage repair, collectively resulting in severe T cell exhaustion and unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Herein, we developed a liposomal nanodrug, C/J-Lipo

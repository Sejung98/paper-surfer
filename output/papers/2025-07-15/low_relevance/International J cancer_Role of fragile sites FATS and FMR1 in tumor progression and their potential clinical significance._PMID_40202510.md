## Abstract
The fragile sites are defined as specific segments of genes that are particularly susceptible to breakage under conditions of accelerated replication stress or certain external influences. It has been demonstrated that fragile sites can influence the progression of various tumors. However, the majority of existing studies have focused on the functions of well-characterized common fragile sites, such as FHIT, WWOX, and PARK2, in different oncogenic processes, with insufficient attention directed towards other fragile sites. This article presents an analysis of recent investigations into the fragile sites, fragile site-associated tumor suppressor (FATS) and fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1), across various tumor types. The article discusses the mechanisms and signaling pathways regulated by these sites in a range of cancers, as well as their clinical implications for tumor treatment. The review highlights the significance of the fragile sites FATS and FMR1 in various cancers and their clinical relevance.

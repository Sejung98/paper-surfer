## Abstract
BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer is an aggressive and heterogeneous disease, primarily sporadic, with only 1-3% of cases being hereditary. However, gastric cancer is a component of several hereditary cancer syndromes. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes encode key DNA repair proteins involved in homologous recombination. Studies suggest a significantly increased risk of gastric cancer in first-degree relatives of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for relevant studies. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using DerSimonian and Laird random-effect models. Heterogeneity was assessed via I RESULTS: Fourteen studies with 160,551 patients were included, of whom 25,934 had BRCA1/2 mutations (BRCA1: 14322; BRCA2: 11612). BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were significantly associated with increased gastric cancer risk (RR 2.30; 95% CI: 1.33-3.97; CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that BRCA1/2 mutation carriers have a higher risk of developing gastric cancer.

## Abstract
Ferroptosis is gaining attention as a potential cancer immunotherapy strategy, as it can stimulate antitumor responses by enhancing dendritic cell (DC) activation and the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). However, cancer cells often develop resistance to ferroptosis, reducing the effectiveness of existing treatments. This study demonstrates a novel mitochondria-targeted ferroptosis inducer, designated mitoFePDA@R, which is engineered to achieve a "closed-loop" cancer immunotherapy strategy of ferroptosis induction, antitumor immune activation, and ferroptosis enhancement. In this strategy, mitoFePDA@R is designed to release Fe

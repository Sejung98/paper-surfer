## Abstract
BACKGROUND: Nodular melanoma (NM) is considered one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, accounting for approximately 10-15% of all melanoma cases. It tends to grow quickly and spread deeper into the skin's layers, providing fewer opportunities for early detection. NM often carries a poor prognosis due to local invasion and frequent distant metastases. BRAF mutations are frequently found in melanoma, with the most common mutation being a single-point mutation at codon 600 (typically V600E). CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of aggressive jugal nodular melanoma harboring an unusual BRAF mutation, C. 1789_1790 CT>TC. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. Sanger sequencing was employed to analyze exon 15 of the BRAF gene. The mutation was validated by bidirectional sequencing and interpreted using reference databases. RESULTS: The identified BRAF mutation, c.1789_1790CT>TC, has been rarely reported in the literature. It results in a non-canonical amino acid substitution, potentially affecting kinase activity and therapeutic response. CONCLUSION: This case underscores the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of nodular melanoma and highlights the importance of comprehensive BRAF mutation screening beyond the common V600E variant.

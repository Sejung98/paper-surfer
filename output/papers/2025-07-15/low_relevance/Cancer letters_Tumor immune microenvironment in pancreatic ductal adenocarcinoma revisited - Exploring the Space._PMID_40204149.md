## Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most deadly malignancies with a highly immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) that hinders effective therapy. PDAC is characterized by significant heterogeneity in immune cell composition, spatial distribution and activation states, which impacts tumor progression and treatment response. Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), including CD4

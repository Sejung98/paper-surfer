## Abstract
Chronic inflammation contributes to the development of colorectal cancer, partly through its regulation of the microenvironment and antitumor immunity. Interestingly, women have a lower incidence of colorectal cancer, and estrogen treatment has been shown to reduce the occurrence of colorectal tumors. While intestinal estrogen receptor beta (ERŒ≤, Esr2) can protect against colitis and colitis-induced cancer in mice, its role in shaping the tumor microenvironment remains unknown. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of colonic epithelia and tumors from azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-treated wild-type and intestinal ERŒ≤ knockout (ERŒ≤KO
